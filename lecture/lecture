I. Why do we Test?
We write codes that might not work. 
Write tests to ensure that it will work
Better for collaboration and not breaking each other's codes
Eliminate false positives

    a. Motivations
        -Check if it works
        -Increase flexibility/reduce fear of change or refactor
        -Very conducive to collaboration
        -Produce documentation

II. What is TDD?
Test driven development
Red - run the tests after writing them... screens for instances of false positives
Green - write minimum amount of code to pass tests
Refactor - make sure it's up to par with your company's style guide

Benefits
-Writing code that passes tests becomes easy... you just wrote the tests
-Only write code that is required
-Enforces modularity... testing suites will help monitor the app piece by piece

III. What do we test?
-everything

Testing Pyramid
top row   : E2E (everything is tested)
middle row: Integration Test (5 ~ 15%)... classes interacting each other
bottom row: Unit Test (80 ~ 90% of the code)... just one class 

IV. RSpec
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) written in Ruby for Ruby
Meta-gem that includes rspec-core, rspec-expectations and rspec-mocks
Not the only Ruby testing library (others include Minitest and Cucumber)
